# Double-Slit-Experiment
The following code models the two-slit experiment

$$I = I_0[\frac{sin(\alpha)}{\alpha}][{cos(\beta)}]^2$$

$$\alpha = \frac{\pi a}{\lambda} sin\theta$$

$$\beta = \frac{\pi d}{\lambda} sin\theta$$

---

I_0 is the initial intensity

I is the intensity at position y

$a$ = 0.09mm is the width of one of the slits

d = 0.4 mm is the distance between the slits

$\lambda$ = 670 nm is the wavelength of the light 

---

1. Set up an array of angle values between defined y values in mm
2. Define known values
3. Calculate values for alpha and beta
4. Plot the graph of intensity versus displacement for the two slits
5. Separate the diffraction term for single slit
6. Plot single and two slits on same graph
7. Create a matrix of values for 1-D pattern repeated in vertical direction
8. Create an image of the matrix of values
9. Alter the Diffraction formula for z direction
10. Find transpose of fall off and multiply it by I
11. Create an image of the data
